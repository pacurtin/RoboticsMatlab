%% Create the rotation matrix R for a -50 degree rotation 
% representing the rotation of frame B with respect to frame A
R = rot2(-50,'deg');

% Create a vector pb of the point (1,4) in the coordinate 
% frame B and find it's respective coordinates in frame A 
% using the rotation matrix R
pb = [1;4]
pa = R*pb

% Now convert point pa back to the reference frame B using
% the transpose of the matrix R, store the result in variable
% pb_from_pa
pb_from_pa = R'*pa

% View the plot a rotated coordinate frame. There is no need to change the following code.
trplot2(R); axis square;
