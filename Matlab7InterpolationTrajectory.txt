% Calculate x(t), with x varying from -2 to +3 and t varying from 0 to 1 in 10 steps.
% Store the time vector in t1 and calculated trajectory in variable x1.
t1 = linspace(0,1,10)
x1= linspace(-2,3,10)

% Repeat this step for 100 time steps.
% Store the time vector in t2 and calculated trajectory in variable x2.
t2 = linspace(0,1,100)
x2 = linspace(-2,3,100)

% Modify to achieve the same motion over 5 seconds (still using 100 steps).
% Store the time vector in t3 and calculated trajectory in variable x3.
t3 = linspace(0,5,100)
x3 = linspace(4,-1,100)

% Using the tpoly function plot x(t) against t for a motion from -2 to +3 over 5 seconds in 100 time steps.
% Store the time vector in tpoly and calculated trajectory in variable xp.
tp = linspace(0,5,100)
xp = tpoly(-2, 3, 100)'

% To visualise the resulting trajectory, uncomment the following line of code.
plot(tp,xp);
