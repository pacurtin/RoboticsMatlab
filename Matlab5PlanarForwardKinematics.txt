% Provided variables
q = [30 -20];

% Find the pose of the end-effector and store in the variable T.
T = trot2(30,'deg') * transl2(0.09,0.03) * trot2(-20,'deg') * transl2(0.07,0)

% Find the x-coordinate in metres and store in the variable x.
x = T(1,3)

% Find the y-coordinate in metres and store in the variable y.
y = T(2,3)

% Find the orientation angle by examining elements of the
% rotation submatrix, element (1,1) which is equal to cos(theta).
% Store in the variable theta. 
theta = acosd(T(1,1))
