% Provided variables
% Array of three vectors
V = [4 -4 0

% Modify the following lines to generate the plot
% Compute the rotation matrix from the data provided
R = rot2(theta,'deg'); 

% Rotate each of the corner points which are given
% by the columns of V by the rotation R and store 
% in the variable Vrot. This may be performed point
% by point, or using the toolbox function homtrans
Vrot = R*V 
% Array of three vectors with rotation applied

% Create the plot ensuring to plot each side of the
% triangle separately. You can use specific code or
% through the use of a loop.

line1x=[Vrot(1,1),Vrot(1,2)]	% The x components of the two end points of the first line
line1y=[Vrot(2,1),Vrot(2,2)]	% The y components of the two end points of the first line
line2x=[Vrot(1,2),Vrot(1,3)]
line2y=[Vrot(2,2),Vrot(2,3)]
line3x=[Vrot(1,3),Vrot(1,1)]
line3y=[Vrot(2,3),Vrot(2,1)]

plot(line1x,line1y,'k')	% Seems like a very strange syntax but there must be some reason for it?
hold on
plot(line2x,line2y,'k')
plot(line3x,line3y,'k')
