% Create a column vector pa to describe the point with coordinate (2,3) using a semicolon to stack the vector.

pa = [2; 3]

% Transpose a row vector [1 4] into a column vector pb using the symbol '.

pb = [1 4]'

% Create a vector ph which has only a horizontal component.

ph = [2; 0]

% Create a vector pv which has only a vertical component.

pv = [0; 3]

% Set the variable psum as the sum of the two vectors ph and pv.

psum = ph + pv


% You can also practise the expressions described for two unit vectors. 

% Enter xhat = [1; 0]

xhat =[1;0]

% Enter yhat = [0; 1]

yhat=[0;1]

% Enter phats = 2*xhat + 3*yhat

phats = 2*xhat + 3*yhat
